# Chasm

Chasm is at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation, providing a robust ecosystem for the creation, deployment, and monetization of AI agents. Central to our platform is Weave, a cutting-edge AI agent builder IDE that allows users to seamlessly develop and deploy AI agents utilizing a variety of decentralized compute resources.

Our next groundbreaking advancement is the Chasm Protocol, a network of decentralized experts designed to evolve into a pseudo-AGI intent network. This protocol will significantly enhance the platform's capabilities by managing payments for compute resources and facilitating advanced exchanges of intents among AI agents, reshaping the operational dynamics and connectivity within the AI landscape.\
