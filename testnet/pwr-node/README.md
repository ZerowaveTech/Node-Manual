# PWR Node

PWR Chain is a blockchain network designed to overcome challenges like scalability, interoperability, and developer accessibility. Unlike traditional blockchains that rely on a single virtual machine architecture, PWR Chain allows for an infinite number of virtual machines and applications to operate independently on top of its base layer. This separation of validation and processing enhances efficiency and scalability, ensuring that one application's performance does not impact others.

The core layer, managed by validator nodes, handles consensus, transactions, block organization, and network security, while the processing of smart contracts and applications occurs separately. This architecture supports over 300,000 transactions per second with instant finality.

PWR Chain's development environment is inclusive, allowing developers to use familiar programming languages and tools. It also features a fixed fee model based on data processed, making transaction costs predictable. These features make PWR Chain a powerful platform for building the next generation of decentralized applications.
