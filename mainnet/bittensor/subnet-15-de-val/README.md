# Subnet 15 - De-Val

## What is De-Val?

Pioneering for the **decentralized evaluation of large language models (LLMs)**. It aims to provide objective, community-driven assessments of LLM outputs, focusing on areas like **hallucination detection**, **misattribution correction**, **summary completeness**, and **relevancy**.

De-Val's miners process evaluation queries by assessing the quality and accuracy of LLM responses, while validators ensure the reliability of these evaluations by comparing them against real-world data and set benchmarks. The subnet offers businesses cost-effective solutions to optimize their AI models through pay-per-query APIs or subscription models. Its roadmap includes expanding capabilities with new evaluation metrics, enhancing API features, and building partnershipsâ€‹

This subnet addresses key challenges in AI, such as detecting nonsensical outputs and ensuring accurate content generation, making it a valuable tool for improving AI-driven applications.
