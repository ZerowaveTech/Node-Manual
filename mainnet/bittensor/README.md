# Bittensor

## What is Bittensor?

It's an innovative decentralized network designed for machine learning (ML), which enables the creation and exchange of AI models through a blockchain system. In Bittensor, participants can build, train, and share ML models in an open, decentralized way, where rewards are given for contributions to the network.

At the core of Bittensor's ecosystem is its **subnet model**, a key architectural feature that fosters collaboration, innovation, and fair compensation across the network.

## Subnet Model

The Bittensor network is composed of various **subnets**â€”semi-autonomous environments where digital commodities like compute, data, predictions, and models are transformed into intelligence. Each subnet operates as its own ecosystem, where participants either consume or produce digital commodities. This model decentralizes the production and distribution of machine learning intelligence, breaking away from the traditional centralized AI systems.

In each subnet, contributors perform specific roles to support the overall growth and functioning of the Bittensor network. These roles include **subnet miners**, **validators**, and **subnet owners**, all of whom collaborate to ensure the efficient flow of intelligence within and across subnets.
